**Human Life**
> Duration: momentary. Nature: changable. Perception: dim. Condition of body: decaying. Soul: spinning around. Fortune: unpredictable. Lasting fame: uncertain.
> Sum up: The body and its parts are a river, the sol is a dream and mist, life is warfare and a journey far from home, lasting reputation is oblivion. - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 17
